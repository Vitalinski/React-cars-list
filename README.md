# Table with cars list
The table features columns of car data retrieved via an API, with the capability to persist information between page reloads. Local pagination optimizes the display, and the search bar positioned above the table allows comprehensive search across all entries, encompassing not just the ones currently visible on the page. In the "Actions" column, a dropdown menu offers a selection of actions, each triggering the opening of a modal window.
